# Northwind SQLite Demo for PHP Web Applications

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the **Northwind Database** ported **SQLite** and serves as a **demo database** for web applications built with **PHP**. The Northwind database is a popular example of fictional business data and includes tables such as **Customers**, **Orders**, **Products**, **Employees**, **Suppliers**, and **Categories**.

A Web Application example PHP implementation for interacting with the SQLite database

It provides an easy way to demonstrate basic web applications with database interaction, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Features  
- Simple **PHP integration** with an SQLite database.
- A **Database Abstraction Layer** and a **Query Builder/Executor** to access MySQL and SQLite databases
- HTML **Form builder**
- HTML **Menu builder**
- Simple **Router**
- **Datagrid** for database **CRUD** operations
- Example **SQL queries** for interacting with the Northwind database.
- Representation of **database relationships** and operations.
- **Data visualization** and **reports** as examples of application development.

## Use Cases  
- **Learning Platform:** Ideal for beginners and advanced users who want to learn how to work with PHP and SQLite.
- **Prototyping:** Fast development of web applications that require a lightweight, embedded database.
- **Demo Application:** Demonstrates the fundamental interaction between a relational database and a web application in PHP.
