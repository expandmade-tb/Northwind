<p>The <strong>Northwind</strong> sample database, originally provided with Microsoft Access, serves as a comprehensive tutorial schema designed to manage various aspects of a small business. It covers key business functions such as <strong>customer management</strong>, <strong>order processing</strong>, <strong>inventory control</strong>, <strong>purchasing</strong>, <strong>supplier management</strong>, <strong>shipping logistics</strong>, and <strong>employee records</strong>. This makes it an ideal starting point for exploring small-business <strong>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)</strong> systems.</p>

<p>While the database includes essential tables for tracking core business processes, it does not implement all views or advanced features. Basic constraints and standard checks are applied to ensure data integrity, but more sophisticated rules or complex business logic are not included in this version.</p>

<p>Currently, this version of the Northwind database is running on a <strong>SQLite</strong> platform, providing an accessible, lightweight environment for learning and experimentation with relational database concepts.</p>
